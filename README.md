Welcome to the Today I Learned App - a simple but full-stack web application that allows users to learn new facts that they didn't know before. With this app, users can browse and filter facts by category, vote on facts, and add their own facts to the list.

## Project Features
- **Fact Listing:** The main feature of the application is the list of facts that users can browse and search through. Each fact is displayed with its corresponding category, fact text, and source.
- **Category Filtering:** Users can filter the facts by category to see only the facts that belong to a specific category, such as Entertainment, Technology, or Science.
- **Fact Voting:** Users can vote on facts to indicate whether they find them interesting or not. They can also mark a fact as false if they believe it to be incorrect.
- **Fact Submission:** Users can submit new facts to the application by filling out a form with the fact text, source, and category.
- **Character Limit:** When submitting a new fact, users must stay within a character limit, which is indicated as they type their fact.
- **Database Integration:** All of the data for the application is stored in a database hosted on a web server. This means that when a user submits a new fact, it is saved into the database and can be retrieved later.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The application updates in real-time, meaning that when a new fact is submitted or a vote is cast, the application updates automatically without the need for a page refresh.

## Technologies Used
- HTML for creating the page content.
- CSS for styling the page.
- Supabase for creating an online database and API for the data needed in the application.
- JavaScript for loading the data into the application and making it interactive.
- React for building the final application.
- Netlify for deploying the final project to a web server.
